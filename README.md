## Welcome to 황현성 pages

You can use the [황현성 홈페이지](https://hhs1260.github.io/quarantinebot/) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files. ### Markdown Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for ```markdown Syntax highlighted code block # Header 1 ## Header 2 ### Header 3 - Bulleted - List ![GiGub Logo](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/02/22/00/06/disinfection-6038290_960_720.jpg){width="50%" height="50%"0}{: .center} 1. Numbered 2. List **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text [Link](url) and ![Image](src) ``` For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). ### Jekyll Themes Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hhs1260/quarantinebot/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file. ### Support or Contact Having trouble with Pages?
